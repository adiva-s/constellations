	<h1 style ="font-family:Times New Roman;">A Starry Night</h1>
	<p style="color: whitesmoke;">in my darkest nights, you made them starry</p>

	<div>
		<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Stars</h3>
		<p style="font-style: italic;">
			I've always like the stars<br>
			Maybe it's because despite the darkness<br>
			They shine so bright<br><br>

			I wish I could be like the stars<br>
			To shine within the darkness<br><br>

			I've always wondered how the stars did it<br>
			Maybe they had happy memories<br>
			Or happiness inside<br> 
			Or something inside<br>
			That makes it worth shining their light<br>
			Through the darkness<br><br>

			It took some time<br>
			But I think i figured it out<br>
			I think I figured out the secrets of the stars<br><br>

			The secret<br>
			Is to look within<br>
			And see what makes you smile day by day<br>
			What makes you keep going<br><br>

			I see you, who came to my side<br>
			When the darkness overcame me<br><br>

			I see you, who brought such a lovely surprise<br>
			Bringing back feelings<br>
			When I thought i could no longer feel<br><br>

			And so maybe<br>
			When it's dark inside<br>
			I remind myself <br>
			It's okay<br>
			Because I have you all<br><br>

			The darkness isn’t so scary after all<br>
			Because it’s not me against it anymore<br><br>

			No rather<br>
			It’s us against it<br>
